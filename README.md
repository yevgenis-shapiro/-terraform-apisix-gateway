##

API Gateway is a traffic entrance to process all business data, including dynamic routing, dynamic upstream, dynamic certificates, A/B testing, canary release, blue-green deployment, limit rate, defense against malicious attacks, metrics, monitoring alarms, service observability, service governance and etc.


### Features
```
‚úÖ High Performance and Scalability:
One of the most significant advantages of APISIX is its high performance and scalability. It can handle thousands of API requests per second, with latency measured in milliseconds. Its stateless architecture allows it to scale horizontally on cloud-native environments

‚úÖ Dynamic Configuration:
APISIX supports dynamic configuration and hot updates without the need for restarting the service. This feature is crucial for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, ensuring minimal downtime and seamless updates.

‚úÖ Extensibility Through Plugins:
APISIX boasts a rich set of plugins, extending its capabilities far beyond simple API routing. These plugins can handle authentication, security, monitoring, and various other API management needs. The plugin-oriented architecture also allows developers to write their plugins, making APISIX highly customizable

‚úÖ Multi-Protocol Support:
Beyond HTTP/HTTPS, APISIX supports a variety of communication protocols, including WebSocket, gRPC, MQTT, and more. This makes it a versatile gateway solution for different types of applications and services.

‚úÖ Security:
Security is a top priority in APISIX. It offers numerous features to safeguard your APIs, such as IP filtering, dynamic SSL certificate handling, OAuth2, JWT authentication, and more, ensuring that your API endpoints are protected against unauthorized access.

‚úÖ Cloud-Native:
Designed for the cloud-native ecosystem, APISIX integrates seamlessly with Kubernetes, providing a powerful API gateway solution for microservices architectures. It supports service discovery and dynamic configuration in a cloud-native environment, making it ideal for modern application deployments.
