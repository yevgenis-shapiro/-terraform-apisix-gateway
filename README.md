##

API Gateway is a traffic entrance to process all business data, including dynamic routing, dynamic upstream, dynamic certificates, A/B testing, canary release, blue-green deployment, limit rate, defense against malicious attacks, metrics, monitoring alarms, service observability, service governance and etc.


### Features
```
‚úÖ Multi protocols

    TCP/UDP Proxy: Dynamic TCP/UDP proxy.
    Dubbo Proxy: Dynamic HTTP to Dubbo proxy.
    Dynamic MQTT Proxy: Supports to load balance MQTT by client_id, both support MQTT 3.1.*, 5.0.
    gRPC proxy: Proxying gRPC traffic.
    gRPC Web Proxy: Proxying gRPC Web traffic to gRPC Service.
    gRPC transcoding: Supports protocol transcoding so that clients can access your gRPC API by using HTTP/JSON.
    Proxy Websocket
    Proxy Protocol
    HTTP(S) Forward Proxy
    SSL: Dynamically load an SSL certificate
    HTTP/3 with QUIC

‚úÖ Full Dynamic

    Hot Updates And Hot Plugins: Continuously updates its configurations and plugins without restarts!
    Proxy Rewrite: Support rewrite the host, uri, schema, method, headers of the request before send to upstream.
    Response Rewrite: Set customized response status code, body and header to the client.
    Dynamic Load Balancing: Round-robin load balancing with weight.
    Hash-based Load Balancing: Load balance with consistent hashing sessions.
    Health Checks: Enable health check on the upstream nodes
    Circuit-Breaker: Intelligent tracking of unhealthy upstream services.
    Proxy Mirror: Provides the ability to mirror client requests.
    Traffic Split: Allows users to incrementally direct percentages of traffic between various upstreams.

‚úÖ Security

    Rich authentication & authorization support:
        key-auth
        JWT
        basic-auth

    Referer Whitelist/Blacklist
    IdP: Support external Identity platforms, such as Auth0, okta, etc..
    Limit-req
    Limit-count
    Limit-concurrency
    Anti-ReDoS(Regular expression Denial of Service): Built-in policies to Anti ReDoS without configuration.
    CORS Enable CORS(Cross-origin resource sharing) for your API.
    URI Blocker: Block client request by URI.
    Request Validator
    CSRF Based on the Double Submit Cookie way, protect your API from CSRF attacks.
